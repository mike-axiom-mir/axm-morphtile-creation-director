# Architecture

src/index.js knows machine roles and packets, not sibling implementations. Callers inject the registry; no machine is assumed installed.

Dependency direction is one-way: this machine may consume MorphTile's public contract; MorphTile core must never import this machine. Candidate output is data, not canon. There is no shared protocol package in this pass: the local envelope copy may only be extracted after multiple real machines prove a stable common contract.

Repository isolation rules: no sibling imports, no sibling writes, no shared mutable state, no assumed installed machines, and no cloud dependency for the tested path.
